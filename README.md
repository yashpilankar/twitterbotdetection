# Twitter Bot Account Detection using Machine Learning

Currently active users on social media are 4.33 billion comparatively 55% more than the actual population. The fact shows how many fake accounts resides over social media. As per last month statistics, 521 Million new users joined social media from April 2020 to April 2021 where whole world was hit by COVID-19.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle website which had two columns i.e twitter user id & Target column The dataset was composed of more than 30,000 twitter accounts which was originally sourced from Botometer repository based on the study. The other features were fetched using Twitter API based on twitter user id shared in the dataset. For each account 45 features were extracted using twitter API. The data was further transformed and different Machine Learning Models were applied and based on the different metrics Random Forest Classifier performed better with acccuracy of 86%.
